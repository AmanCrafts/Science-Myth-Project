        <h2>Truth:</h2>
        <p class="slide-in">While space is a vacuum, meaning it lacks a medium like air to carry sound waves, this doesn't mean it's entirely silent. For example, radio waves from celestial objects can be detected and converted into sound. Some spacecraft have recorded vibrations from planetary magnetospheres and converted them into eerie, audible sounds.
