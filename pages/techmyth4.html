            Explanation of the Myth:
        </h2>
        <p>This myth suggests that Apple Mac computers are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, unlike Windows PCs. Many Mac users believe that because their computers run macOS, they don’t need antivirus software or to worry about cyber threats in the same way Windows users do. The idea is that macOS is inherently more secure than Windows, making Macs less susceptible to infections.</p>

        <h2>Debunking the Myth:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Macs Are Not Immune to Malware:</h4>
                    While it’s true that macOS is less targeted than Windows, Macs absolutely can get viruses and other forms of malware. In fact, the rise in popularity of Apple products in recent years has made them an increasingly attractive target for hackers. There are several examples of malware specifically designed for macOS, including Trojan horses, adware, and ransomware.

                    <h4>Increased Attacks on Macs:</h4>
                    As Macs have become more popular, they have increasingly been targeted by cybercriminals. According to various cybersecurity reports, macOS has been seeing a rise in malware infections in recent years. For example, the "MacDefender" malware in 2011 was a significant early sign that Macs were vulnerable. It was a form of scareware that tricked users into installing malicious software by pretending to be legitimate antivirus software.

                    <h4>Real-World Malware Examples:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Shlayer Malware (2018):</h5>
                            One of the most prevalent malware strains targeting Macs in recent years is Shlayer, a form of adware that infects macOS through fake software updates and browser extensions. It has been reported to have infected over 30% of all Macs in the wild.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Silver Sparrow (2021):</h5>
                            Another notable example is Silver Sparrow, a sophisticated piece of malware that was able to infect Macs even before the user logged in, and it used Apple’s M1 chip in its attack. It demonstrated that new forms of malware can target even the latest Apple hardware.

                        <li>
                            <h5>Adware and Rogue Software:</h5>
                            Mac users have also fallen victim to a variety of adware and rogue software (e.g., apps that claim to improve system performance but actually install malicious software).

                    <h4>macOS Vulnerabilities:</h4>
                    Like any operating system, macOS has its own set of vulnerabilities. Security researchers regularly discover zero-day vulnerabilities (flaws in the system that hackers can exploit before Apple fixes them). While Apple is generally quick to release security patches, no operating system is immune from attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Ransomware and Phishing Attacks:</h4>
                    Ransomware, which encrypts your files and demands payment for their release, is also a growing threat for macOS users. Although ransomware on macOS is less common than on Windows, it is still a real risk. Moreover, phishing attacks—where attackers attempt to steal login credentials or other sensitive information through fraudulent websites or emails—are just as common on Macs as they are on Windows PCs.

                <li>
                    <h4>macOS Security Tools Aren’t Foolproof:</h4>
                    While macOS comes with built-in security features, like XProtect, Gatekeeper, and Notarization, these are not foolproof. For example, Gatekeeper can block apps from unidentified developers, but if a user bypasses this feature and installs malicious software, the operating system won’t necessarily stop it. Similarly, XProtect can detect known malware, but if the malware is new or hasn't been identified yet, it might go undetected.

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
            The myth that "Macs don’t get viruses" is dangerously misleading. While macOS has a reputation for being more secure than Windows, it is not immune to viruses, malware, or cyberattacks. As the popularity of Macs continues to rise, so does the number of threats targeting them.
        </p>
        <p>Users need to take their digital security seriously, regardless of the platform they use. This includes keeping the system updated with the latest security patches, being cautious about downloading and installing software, avoiding suspicious links or attachments, and considering the use of antivirus software.</p>
        <p>In short, Macs can and do get viruses, and security practices should be followed just as diligently as on any other platform.</p>
