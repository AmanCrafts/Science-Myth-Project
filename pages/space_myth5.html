        <h2>Truth:</h2>
        <p class="slide-in">Astronauts float because they are in free fall, not because there is no gravity. Gravity exists even at the International Space Station (ISS), but the station and its occupants are constantly falling toward Earth while moving forward, creating a sensation of weightlessness.
