        <h2>Myth: "There is no gravity in space."</h2>
      
        <p class="fade-in">Many people believe that astronauts float because there is no gravity in spacees.</p>
        <h2>Why this myth exists?</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Weightlessness Misinterpreted: When astronauts float in the International Space Station (ISS), it appears as though there’s no gravity. In reality, the ISS and its occupants are in free-fall around Earth.
          Misleading Terminology: The phrase "zero gravity" is often used to describe the conditions in orbit, further propagating the myth.</p>

      <div class="truth">
        <h2>Truth:</h2>
        <p class="slide-in">Gravity is a universal force that diminishes with distance but never truly disappears. The strength of gravity decreases with the square of the distance from the mass generating it (Inverse-Square Law).
          Even in deep space, far from Earth or other planets, gravity from distant stars and galaxies is still present, although extremely weak.

      <div class="truth">
        <h2>Additional Facts:</h2>
        <p class="slide-in">1) Orbiting Objects Aren’t Escaping Gravity: The ISS orbits Earth at an altitude of about 400 km (250 miles), where Earth’s gravity is still about 90% as strong as it is on the surface. The station’s orbital velocity (approximately 28,000 km/h or 17,500 mph) counteracts the pull of gravity, keeping it in orbit.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="slide-in">2)Gravitational Effects on Light: Even light can be affected by gravity, as demonstrated by gravitational lensing—a phenomenon where massive objects like galaxies bend light from distant stars.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="slide-in">3)Astronaut Health in Microgravity: Prolonged exposure to microgravity affects astronauts' health, including muscle atrophy, bone loss, and fluid distribution changes in the body, showing that gravity (or its lack) plays a crucial role in biological processes.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="slide-in">4)Tidal Forces: Gravitational interactions between Earth and the Moon cause ocean tides. Similar tidal forces occur in space, such as the "spaghettification" of objects near a black hole due to intense gravitational gradients.
