        <h2>Truth:</h2>
        <p class="slide-in">You wouldn’t explode, but it would still be fatal. Without a spacesuit, the lack of external pressure would cause your bodily fluids to boil and evaporate due to reduced boiling points. However, you'd lose consciousness from lack of oxygen within about 15 seconds, and death would follow shortly after.
